The simulation system is designed to:
1. Test game mechanics
2. Verify RTP (Return to Player)
3. Analyze volatility
4. Ensuring game fairness and reliability
5. Verifying mathematical models
6. Validate bonus features
	- Game volatility
	- Win distribution
	- Maximum win potential
	- Risk levels
7. Generate comprehensive reports
8. Collect detailed metrics
9. Discover Win patterns
10. Performance Testing
11. Balance Verification
	- Game balance
	- Win limits
	- Payout ratios
	- Feature frequencies
